        <p>Art is defined by four definitions when you Google it. The first definition of art is: </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+art&oq=define+art&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3900j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.</blockquote>

        <p>The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination encompases a lot of things. I am trying to show people that art can be made through the use of coding. I am a computer science major at University at Buffalo, and I am taking DMS courses to get the Game Studies certificate. The DMS courses that I have taken have shown me that my skill of coding can be expressed in art form. This whole time I’ve been doing projects trying to calculate random problems, trying to make interpreters, trying to use different data structures to store data in etc. in my computer science courses. Now I have the opportunity of using my skill to make something that I can see the result of and even interact with.</p>

        <p>This piece that I have made is called “It’s Just Blocks and Color.” I named my project this because when I showed my little brother my artwork, he called it that. For a little bit I was offended because I spent a lot of time trying to perfect the way my art looked. When he said that, I felt like the value of my art went down. I then started to think why I felt this way. I realized that I was wrong. This art literally was just Blocks and Color. It’s just art… not a coding project. I want to show people that it is very simple to use coding and make artwork. Something as simple as blocks and color can be done using only Javascript. Coding to me can be used as another tool to make artwork. </p>
